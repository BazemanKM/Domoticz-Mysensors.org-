Original script by: Danny (dannybloe):
This script controls the humidity in a typical bathroom setting by detecting
relative rises in humidity in a short period.
Of course it requires a humidity sensor and a binary switch controlling a fan/ventilator.
(there is no provision for variable speed ventilators here!)
 
How it works (assuming the default constants as defined below):
Every 5 minutes a reading is done. Every reading is stored together
with the previous reading and is stored in two user variables (humidityTmin5 and humidityTmin10).
So it has two reading over the past 10 minutes.
It then takes the lowest of the two and compares it with the latest reading and
calculates a delta.
If the delta is 3 or higher (see constants) then the fan will be turned
on, it calculates the target humidity and the 'humidity-decrease program' is started (fanFollowsProgram=1).
From then on, every 5 minutes the current humidity is compared to the
stored target humidity. Basically if that target is reached, the fan is turned off
and the 'program' is ended.
Of course, it is possible that the target is never reached (might start raining outside
or whatever). Then there is a failsafe (FAN_MAX_TIME) after which the ventilator
will be turned off.
 
Also, it will detect if the ventilator is manually switched off during a program
or when it is switched on before the program starts.
 
Along the lines it prints to the log and sends notifications
but of course you can turn that off by removing those lines.

Modification by Gertjan (BazemanKM):
Added 3 stage fanbox ventilation controls.
